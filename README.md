Figma plugin that answers the question “How should I name this color?” once and for all.

Select any node with solid fill and see the name of the color or the list of color names closest to it.

This plugin searches through HTML color names and “Name that Color” list and computes the Euclidean distance to find colors that are closest to selected.
